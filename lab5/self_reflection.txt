You must answer at least 4 questions, but the remaining ones are optional. The main goal of this file is to get you thinking critically about your own work, but we will also use these self reflections at the end of the semester when we do our internal review of the course.

ArrayDeque:

Q: Give an example of at least one idea from the staff solution that would have made your solution better (if any).

A: Maybe write a separate private function for increment and decrement to avoid repetition
   Adding different constructors that allow to immediately add items

Q: What's something you felt proud of in your code, if anything?

A: The way in which resize was implemented, which avoided complicated math and thinking about the interal structure of an array

Q: What's something that was particularly inelegant in your code, if anything?

A: Repetition of certain bits of code, which could have been placed in helper functions

Q: What did you learn by talking to your partner about writing ArrayDeque?

A:

Q: What do you wish you would have known before writing ArrayDeque, if anything?

A: Modulo doesn't work as expected with negative numbers

Q: If you wrote ArrayDeque again, what would you do differently, if anything?

A:

LinkedListDeque:

Q: Give an example of at least one idea from the staff solution that would have made your solution better (if any).

A: 

Q: What's something you felt proud of in your code, if anything?

A: The simplicity and ease of reading, even without comments

Q: What's something that was particularly inelegant in your code, if anything?

A: Making a helper class within a method for getRecursive. A better solution would have been a separate helper method
